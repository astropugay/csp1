        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>A track bicycle or track bike is a bicycle optimized for racing at a velodrome or outdoor track. Unlike road bicycles, the track bike is a fixed-gear bicycle; thus, it has only a single gear ratio and has neither a freewheel nor brakes. Tires are narrow and inflated to high pressure to reduce rolling resistance. Tubular tires are most often used in track racing and training, though advances in clincher tire design have seen them being used somewhat more often.</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Track cycling has been around since at least 1870. When cycling was in its infancy, wooden indoor tracks were laid which resemble those of modern velodromes, consisting of two straights and slightly banked turns.
          <br>
          One appeal of indoor track racing was that spectators could be easily controlled, and hence an entrance fee could be charged, making track racing a lucrative sport. Early track races attracted crowds of up to 2000 people. Indoor tracks also enabled year-round cycling for the first time. The main early centers for track racing in Britain were Birmingham, Sheffield, Liverpool, Manchester and London.
          <br>
          The most noticeable changes in over a century of track cycling have concerned the bikes themselves, engineered to be lighter and more aerodynamic to enable ever-faster times.
          <br>
        With the exception of the 1912 Olympics, track cycling has been featured in every modern Olympic Games. Women's track cycling was first included in the modern Olympics in 1988.</p>

        <h3>Featured Athlete</h3>   
        <div class="feature"></div>     
        <p>This is Kelli Samuelson–aspiring to be a professional cyclist soon (Go Kelli!) and custom painting Ritte Bikes when off the bike. As a brutally inspiring role model in women’s cycling, she is running the Ritte Women’s Team and plays an active part in the Women’s Cycling Association (WCA). We met her together with her partner Ty Hathaway on a beautiful sunny day in March in L.A. for a ride up Angeles Crest.</p>
