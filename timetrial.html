      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>In many racing sports an athlete (or occasionally a team of athletes) will compete in a time trial against the clock to secure the fastest time. In cycling, for example, a time trial (TT) can be a single track cycling event, or an individual or team time trial on the road, and either or both of the latter may form components of multi-day stage races. In contrast to other types of races, athletes race alone since they are sent out in intervals (interval starts), as opposed to a mass start.</p>

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>In order to ensure a measure of uniformity in the conduct of road time trials, a group of cycling clubs formed the Road Racing Council in 1922. Membership was confined to founder clubs and to clubs promoting open events. A set of recommendations was agreed upon and for fifteen years the sport flourished to such an extent that it became necessary in 1937, in view of the modern traffic conditions and the ever increasing number of events and competitors, to review the whole position.</p>

      <h3>Featured Athlete</h3>
      <div class="feature"></div>      
      <p>Sir Bradley Marc Wiggins, CBE (born 28 April 1980) is a British former professional road and track racing cyclist, who competed professionally between 2001 and 2016. Nicknamed "Wiggo", he began his cycling career on the track, but has made the transition to road cycling and is one of the few cyclists to gain significant elite level success in both those forms of professional cycling. He is the only rider to have combined winning both World and Olympic championships on both the track and the road, as well as winning the Tour de France, and holding the iconic track hour record. In addition, he has worn the leader's jersey in each of the three Grand Tours of cycling and as of 2016 holds the world record in team pursuit.</p>
